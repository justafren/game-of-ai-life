User: I want to create a Python program based on the Game of Life by John Conway - I'd like a GUI interface and the ability to click on the grid to add 'alive' cells. Can you write this for me?

AI: Sure! I can help you with that. Let's start by creating a Python program with a GUI interface for the Game of Life.
[Code provided]

User: Can you update it so that when I press Enter the Game of Life rules are continually applied until the cells stop moving?

AI: Certainly! To update the code so that the Game of Life rules are continually applied until the cells stop moving, we can modify the game loop. [Code provided]
User: Can you create a requirements.txt file for this program?

AI: Certainly! Here's a `requirements.txt` file that includes the necessary dependencies for running the program. [Requirements.txt content provided]
User: Can you create a README file that explains how to run and play the game, please?

AI: Certainly! Here's a sample `README.md` file that explains how to run and play the Game of Life program. [README.md content provided]

User: I have two versions of the program - game_of_life.py which just updates one iteration when you press Enter and another game_of_life_play.py which updates continuously until it no more movement when the user presses Enter - can you update the README to reflect this?

AI: Certainly! Here's an updated version of the `README.md` file that reflects the two versions of the program. [Updated README.md content provided]

User: Can you write instructions to run this in a virtualenv using Python 3.8?

AI: Certainly! Here are instructions for running the program in a virtual environment using Python 3.8. [Instructions provided]

User: Can you consolidate the entire chat history into one text file, please?
